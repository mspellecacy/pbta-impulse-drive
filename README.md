# Impulse Drive Character Sheet
For use with the [PbtA System](https://asacolips.gitbook.io/pbta-system/)

### Notes
Took some liberties with the overall layout used by the PbtA System, and there are things that the system doesn't 
support well, like a secondary checkbox for ship "Spot Repairs", but overall these sheets should serve their purpose
for my game.
